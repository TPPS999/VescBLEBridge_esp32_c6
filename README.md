VescBLEBridge is a project that lets you add Bluetooth connectivity to your Vesc Controller for only 3€. It utilizes the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C6 microcontroller as a cost-effective BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) module. It allows seamless communication between your Vesc controllers and the Vesc Tool App.

## Features

- **Compact Design:** The XIAO ESP32-C6's small form factor makes it an ideal choice for applications where space is a constraint.

- **Cost-Effective:** Utilizing the XIAO ESP32-C6 as a BLE module provides a budget-friendly alternative to an NRF module for integrating Bluetooth connectivity into Vesc controllers.

- **User-Friendly:** VescBLEBridge is designed to be easy to use, with straightforward setup and configuration. Prebuild versions with flashed firmware and soldered connectors are also planned.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Setup:
**What you need:**
- [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C6](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32C6-p-5884.html)
- Some Wires
- Fitting connector for your Vesc Uart port (Most likely JST-PH2.0)
- USB C Cable

Connect the XIAO ESP32-C6 to your Vesc controller following the table below.

| XIAO ESP32-C6 || VESC         |
| ------------- |-| ------------|
| 5V            |->| 5V         |
| GND           |->| GND        |
| D7 (GPIO17)   |->| RX         |
| D6 (GPIO16)   |->| TX         |

If it doesnt work you can try swapping rx and tx pins cause they are swapped on some vesc controllers.

### Flashing Firmware:
To flash the firmware to the esp you need the following prerequisites:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [PlattformIO IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide)  extension for VSCode

Once you have VSCode and its PlattformIO extension installed, you need to open this git repo in VSCode. Then connect the esp32 to your computer and hit upload.

If you have trouble you can read the official [PlattformIO docs](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#ide-vscode)
